The IT Helpdesk Ticketing System is a full-stack application designed to manage IT support requests efficiently.
It allows users to raise tickets, track their status, and receive resolutions, while administrators can assign, prioritize, and resolve issues based on SLA and severity.

This project simulates a real-world enterprise IT support environment.
